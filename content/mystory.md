I grew up as a happy child, deeply loved by my grandparents, who showed their affection in the most caring way they knew — with food. It was a beautiful time of warmth and comfort, but as a result, I became a heavy child who didn't enjoy movement and always ran last in P.E. classes.

<br/>
By the time I reached middle school, I began to feel the effects of that lifestyle: low energy, slow digestion, constant constipation, weight gain, and growing insecurity. I started using food not only for nourishment but as emotional comfort — a way to feel safe and loved like I did as a child. It felt like a cycle I couldn't escape.
<br/>

But one day, something inside me shifted. I was in middle school. I realized I wasn't happy with how I felt in my body and in my life. I started asking myself:

*What can I change to feel balanced, strong, and alive again?*


<br/>


That question marked the beginning of my wellness journey — one that would turn into a lifelong path of learning, healing, and transformation.


<br/>




At first, I started running — even though I used to hate it. I started to run short distances with friends, and when they gave up, I kept going, just to see what might happen in a month. Slowly, I fell in love with the fresh morning air, quiet sunrises, and the peace of being alone with myself. My body began to change. My digestion improved. My energy grew. I started reaching little goals I never thought possible, because I disciplined myself.


<br/>




That's when I learned something life-changing:

***Small things you do every day can change everything.***

Years passed, and when I had my first child, I found myself in a new kind of challenge, dealing with exhaustion, postpartum depression, and the loss of connection to my body. Also, because that time was a hard part of my life. I felt small and powerless under the weight of it all. One day, I knew I had to act. If I don't, I might fall into a real depression.

That moment was the turning point.

I began running again, just a little, and then found a few beginner yoga videos online. At first, I thought of yoga as just physical stretches — a way to gently move my body. I started feeling better, lighter, calmer, and more hopeful.

I kept going. And then I discovered that yoga was much more than movement.

I discovered meditation, moments of quiet I hadn't known I needed, breathwork (Pranayama), patterns of breathing that opened my body and mind in the most healing way.

My flexibility improved, my moods lifted, my energy returned. People around me began noticing the glow in my face and the strength in my body. They started asking what I was doing. I began sharing, and that's when I knew this journey wasn't just for me. It was meant to be shared.

That passion led me to the birthplace of yoga — Rishikesh, India — where I became a certified yoga teacher. For over six years, I taught and trained, helping people reconnect to their bodies, minds, and breath. But I wanted to go further. I wanted to combine yoga with strength training, with functional movement, with science.

I kept running, completed marathons and Spartan races, and eventually decided to chase a dream I had had since school, to enter a bodybuilding competition. It was a new world, but I started from scratch, step by step, supported by an amazing trainer who believed in me.

Through this process, I became a certified Personal Trainer and Nutritionist, and built the knowledge to craft programs that supported not just aesthetics, but sustainable well-being.

I've lived through the struggle — from emotional eating and burnout to physical exhaustion and disconnection from my body. And I've also lived the transformation.

Today, I bring together everything I've learned — yoga, strength training, breathwork, nutrition, and mindset — to help others feel strong, balanced, and empowered in their bodies and lives.

Because I know how it feels to start over.

I know how it feels to rebuild.

And I know how powerful it feels to rise.

If you're ready to return to yourself, I'm here to walk that journey with you — with care, strength, and everything I've learned along the way.
